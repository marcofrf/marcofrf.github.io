                        Devenir Urdimbre is an immersive installation that combines sculpture, digital visualization, and sound composition to create a constantly vibrating perceptual field.
                    <p>
                        Designed and printed by Manel Bafaluy, the sculptures inhabit the space as organic and abstract forms that embody latent energy. Each form embodies an active tension and a presence that opens to resonance. A cloud of dots programmed by Marco Ferreira runs through the room, projecting luminous figures that evoke liquid rosettesâ€”fleeting patterns that articulate the space as if matter itself were woven in light. Eddgem's soundscape envelops the experience with layers of frequency and depth, breathing life into the whole and causing it to reverberate.

                        In this exhibition, the warp emerges as a collective gesture that reveals the cosmic forces running through us. Like a digital illusion, the threads of light and vibration create an interwoven appearance that reveals, rather than conceals, the intimate fabric of the world. Digital interweaving becomes a form of sensitive knowledge where matter organizes itself according to invisible rhythms. The installation invites an attentive gaze, opening us to the dance of particles, frequencies, and forms that constitute us.</p>
